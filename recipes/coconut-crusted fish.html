         <h2>Steps to making this DELICIOUS recipe</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the mango salsa: stir together the mango, onion, lime juice, red pepper, vinegar, sugar, vegetable oil, cilantro and curry powder in a bowl. Season salsa with salt and pepper to taste and set aside.</li>
                <li>Place the shredded coconut in a food processor and pulse very briefly, until they are a bit more finely shredded. Add 1/3 cup flour, cummin, curry powder, salt and pepper and pulse mix. Transfer mixture to a shallow plate.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, whisk the egg with 1 tablespoon water. Place the remaining 1/3 cup flour on a second plate.</li>
                <li>Dredge the fillets first in the plain flour shaking off excess), then in the egg mixture (letting excess drip off), and finally in the coconut mixture, coating both sides completely.</li>
                <li>Heat the olive oil and the butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté the fillets until they are browned on both sides and cooked through on the inside, about 2-3 mins per side.</li>
                <li>Spoon a bit of mango salsa on each fillet and ENJOY!</li>
            </ol>
